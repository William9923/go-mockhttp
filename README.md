# mockhttpclient

What I need:

- Datastore adapter => try to read how casbin works... => for now try just to use in memory one... => DONE
- usecase/mocker.go & usecase/rule_intepreter.go => we need it for the CheckMock
- using it (+ more refactoring) => i then can apply the same rules, with predefined response?

This is how we will parse the file:
