# mockhttpclient

TODO:

- Better unit testing:
  1. collection.go => more unit test on many different case here
  2. client.go =>
  3. resolver.go =>
- Support more than GET & POST, can refer from http client
- Make better documentation (README) & make better example
- Learn on how to make integration testing, can refer many sources (like lazygit is pretty good)
